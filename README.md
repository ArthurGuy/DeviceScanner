# DeviceScanner

This is a simple python script that runs on a Raspberry Pi and scans for nearby bluetooth devices which are broadcasting an ID. The list of devices is then tidied up and posted to a server.

The script is designed to load on startup and display basic data on an LCD shield, if one is attached.
